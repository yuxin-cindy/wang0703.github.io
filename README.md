When I did this final assignment, I was very excited because I wanted my portfolio to present my style and my capability. I spent a lot of time to change the photos. Although I used 2 pictures form the internet, I wanted to use my own photos all of them.  Even now, I am also not very satisfied. I hope that in the future, I will shoot more nice photos to replace the old ones. 
Through this creation, I learned that a good website not only has a good design, but also has good content. Maybe my mockup was not very difficult, so the process of implementing the code was smooth. Although I encountered some problems, I overcame them by reviewing my old code and googling it.  I want to add more sophisticated code like JavaScript to make my portfolio livelier, but now I donâ€™t know how to add them. In the future, I hope that I can learn more code skills to improve my portfolio.
